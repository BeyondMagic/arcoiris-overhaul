# Vim-RNB, a Vim colorscheme template

## What is this thing?

RNB is a template designed to help vimmers create their own colorschemes without much effort.

## How do I use it?

The process is divided in four steps:

1. start by editing your colorscheme's information,
2. define your colors,
3. define your highlight groups and links,
4. and generate your colorscheme.

Each step is thoroughly described in the colorscheme template: `src/rnb.erb`.

## How does it work?

The templates in this repository use ERB, Ruby's built-in templating system, so you will need a working Ruby installation to generate your colorscheme. Ruby knowledge is not needed at all, though.

This repository contains two templates: `src/rnb.erb`, the colorscheme template, and `src/readme.erb`, the README template.

### The colorscheme template

The template is split into two sections of which only the first is of interest to the casual user.

#### First section: the settings

#### Second section: the template

### The README template
